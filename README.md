# case_studies

## Purpose

This repository can be used to show examples of `pywavelet' in use. 

At the moment there are some basic examples, demonstrating the forward and backwards WDM transformation on a simple monochromatic and chirping sinusoid. Similarly, there are more advdanced examples showing the impact of gaps on the wavelet domain. 

## Requirements

Set up environment

conda create env -n pywavelet_env
pip install pywavelet
